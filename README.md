# Banking
On our sixth week at Eskwelabs, we had a hackathon on telemarketing potential fixed-term deposit customers. Who do you call when you have a limited amount of time and manpower?

Details on the dataset can be found on the uploaded .txt file ('bank-additional-names.txt')

The dataset was dirty when I received it so a separate notebook is uploaded for data cleaning. The final dataset that I used to model is the banking.csv file.

I used a random forest classification model and grid search to look for the best parameters.
